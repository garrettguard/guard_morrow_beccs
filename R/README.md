These R snippets were used to help analyze GCAM results and create charts using [rgcam](https://github.com/jgcri/rgcam) and ggplot.

Many of these snippets have variable names for different SSPs hard-coded into them. These variable names will need to be changed throughout the snippet (e.g., replacing `SSP2` with `SSP1`).

See individual code snippets for documentation.
