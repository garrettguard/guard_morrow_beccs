# GCAM_BECCS_R_Graphs_Code

This repository contains XML files used to run scenarios in [GCAM](https://github.com/jgcri/gcam-core) for a study of the global implications of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), as well as snippets of R code for analyzing and graphing results from those scenarios.

The documentation in this repository assumes familiarity with GCAM, R, and [rgcam](https://github.com/jgcri/rgcam).
